To run this code, you will need the following libraries installed:
  numpy
  argparse
  PIL
  matplotlib

question1.py does image quantization as told in question 1. You can run the program using the following prompt in the terminal:
    python3 question1.py -f lenna
    python3 question1.py -f (filename)

If '-f' is ommitted, it will automatically run on the "peppers.png" file.

question2.py does image sampling as told in question 2. You can run the program using the following prompt in the terminal:
    python3 question2.py -f lenna
    python3 question2.py -f (filename)

If '-f' is ommitted, it will automatically run on the "peppers.png" file.

question3.py does Histogram Equalization as told in question 2. You can run the program using the following prompt in the terminal:
    python3 question3.py -f boat
    python3 question3.py -f (filename)

You can also run the test of equalization using the following command prompts
    python3 question3.py -t 10
    python3 question3.py -t 64 -l 100
    python3 question3.py -t 256 -l 200 -s 20  

Setting the '-t' flag to anything will generate an NxN image using a normal distribution. The center of the normal distribution can be changed using the '-l' flag, and the spead (sigma) can be changed using the '-s' flag.
